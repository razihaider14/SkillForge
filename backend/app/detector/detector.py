Public API for the technology detector.

External callers use detect_technologies() for the stable list[str] interface,
or detect_technologies_detailed() for the richer MatchResult form.

Internal modules (engine, matchers, models, rules) are implementation details
and should not be imported directly by code outside app/detector/.
